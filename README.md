## Lessons Learned

In this program I am practicing accessing data from a .txt file using BufferedReader. 
I Instantiated an ArrayList and populated it with my .txt file as well as User input and decisions using Scanner. 

The keyword 'implements' is used to declare an interface. 

An interface is a 'contract' or 'promise' that ensures the program acts as intended. 
The interface says: The methods in the interface WILL be implemented by the implenting Class.

All methods from a class implementing a interface must be called with no arguments in the interface.
